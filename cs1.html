            Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
            An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability 
            (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), 
            and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.
