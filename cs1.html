            Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It was created by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991. 
            Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability by using whitespace indentation instead of curly brackets or keywords. It has a 
            syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.
