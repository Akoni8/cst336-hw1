            <span class="language">Python</span> is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It was created by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991. 
            <span class="language">Python</span> has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability by using whitespace indentation instead of curly brackets or keywords. 
            It has a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of 
            code than might be used in languages such as <span class="language">C++</span> or <span class="language">Java</span>.
